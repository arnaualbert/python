# PyNative Exercises
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Here is a list of exercises for practice.
  All exercises are in a web site called "PyNative".
- All exercises are solved. Try to write your code before looking at the solution.
  Write each exercise in a separate file to avoid problems (IMPORTANT).
  For the hardest exercises, divide the exercise in several functions.
  Writing first on paper the top-down design helps a lot.
- Do them in the suggested order. Functions are easy and loops are hard.
- It is important to practice the string and loop exercises.
  They are a good preparation for the exam.
- Look at my solutions for some exercises in "5. Loop exercises".
  Try to code like my solutions, rather than the ones in the PyNative web.
- Remember to use the debugger to see the types and values of variables.
